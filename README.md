# seqkit-grep search of QLLVW motifs in unassembled data
Unassembled RNA-seq data was searched for the presence of the stephanotic acid core peptide motif QLLVW with seqkit from 6frame-translated raw read data as follows:
1. SRA-download â€“ see transcriptome assembly
Raw RNA-seq datasets were downloaded as described under SRA download with sratoolkit (v2.10.9).
2. Trimming
Raw RNA-seq datasets were trimmed by TrimGalore with default settings with the following script in batch mode (see instructions in Transcriptome assembly):
